# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!. You can contribute
code, documentation, tests, bug reports. Every little bit helps, and credit will
always be given. If you plan to make a contribution it would be great if you
first announce that on [the issue
tracker](https://github.com/textX/textX/issues).

You can contribute in many ways:


## Types of Contributions


### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/textX/textX/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.


### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.


### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.


### Write Documentation

textX could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official textX docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.


### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/textX/textX/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)


## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `textX` for local development.

1. Fork the `textX` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

        $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/textX.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have
   [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest) installed, this is how you
   set up your fork for local development:

        $ cd textX/
        $ virtualenv venv
        $ source venv/bin/activate
        $ pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
        $ pip install -e .
        
    Previous stuff is needed only the first time. To continue working on textX
    later you just do:
    
        $ cd textX/
        $ source venv/bin/activate
        
    Note that on Windows sourcing syntax is a bit different. Check the docs for
    virtualenv.
        
    An excellent overview of available tools for Python environments management
    can be found
    [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41573587/what-is-the-difference-between-venv-pyvenv-pyenv-virtualenv-virtualenvwrappe)
    
    To verify that everything is setup properly run tests:
    
        $ flake8 tests/functional/
        $ py.test tests/functional/

4. Create a branch for local development::

        $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
   tests:

        $ flake8 textX tests
        $ py.test tests/functional/

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

        $ git add .
        $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
        $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.


## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds/changes functionality, the docs should be updated. 
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7, 3.4-3.7. Check
   https://travis-ci.org/textX/textX/pull_requests and make sure that
   the tests pass for all supported Python versions.


## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

```
$ py.test tests/functional/mytest.py
```

or a single test:

```
$ py.test tests/functional/mytest.py::some_test
```
